# Templates

Code from class

function templates can be found in the files:

 - app0.cpp
 - template_funcs.cpp
 - Lab3_Templates.h and Lab3_Templates.cpp -- redone version of the earlier labs that you did this semester, using template functions

class (struct) templates can be found in:

- pair.h

app.cpp uses the pair class as well as the map class of the STL

See the repository of the SimpleVectorTemplate class to see another example of a template class.
